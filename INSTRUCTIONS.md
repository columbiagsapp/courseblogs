# GSAPP Course Blog Instructions and Policies

GSAPP uses Tumblr for many course blogs to do collective research and post assignments and design progress online. Please read this entire document before beginning to post to a GSAPP course blog.


## Copyright Policy

You must _not_ post any copyrighted material that is not your own on the course blog. This includes images, audio, video, etc, and any copyrighted material you may have used to create your work that you do not have the right to use.


## Attribution

For all uploads to the tumblr blog, be sure to tag each post with your Columbia UNI (eg. abc1234). Your instructor may ask you to follow additional conventions for tagging posts.


## Tumblr Account Setup

Only if you do not already have a personal tumblr account, go to tumblr.com and click the Sign Up button. Use any email and username you like, this will be your personal account and is not necessarily GSAPP related. When you join a GSAPP tumblr blog it will be added to your blog list, allowing you to post from your personal account.


## Joining Your Course Blog

You will receive an email from Tumblr allowing you to join your course blog. Before you click on the link in the email you need to be logged in to your own tumblr account Once you are logged in, click on the link. This will take you to tumblr and confirm that you are now a member of the ADRII tumblr blog, which will allow you to post to it.
